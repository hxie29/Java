/*((Connected rectangles) Listing 28.10, ConnectedCircles.java, allows the user
to create circles and determine whether they are connected. Rewrite the program
for rectangles. The program lets the user create a rectangle by clicking a
mouse in a blank area that is not currently covered by a rectangle. As the rectangles
are added, the rectangles are repainted as filled if they are connected or
are unfilled otherwise, as shown in Figure 28.25bâ€“c.*/
