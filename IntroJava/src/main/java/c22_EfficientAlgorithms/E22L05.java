/*In fact, we can prove that if n is not a prime, n must have a factor that is greater than
1 and less than or equal to 2n. Here is the proof. Since n is not a prime, there exist two
numbers p and q such that n = pq with 1 6 p â€¦ q. Note that n = 2n 2n. p must be
less than or equal to 2n. Hence, you need to check only whether 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . , or 2n
divides n. If not, n is prime. This significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm
to O(sqrt(n))*/
